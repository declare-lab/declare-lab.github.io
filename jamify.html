            <p class="abstract">
                Diffusion and flow-matching models have revolutionized automatic text-to-audio generation in recent times. These models are increasingly capable of generating high quality and faithful audio outputs capturing to speech and acoustic events. However, there is still much room for improvement in creative audio generation that primarily involves music and songs. Recent open lyrics-to-song models, such as, DiffRhythm, ACE-Step, and LeVo, have set an acceptable standard in automatic song generation for recreational use. However, these models lack fine-grained word-level controllability often desired by musicians in their workflows. To the best of our knowledge, our flow-matching-based JAM is the first effort toward endowing word-level timing and duration control in song generation, allowing fine-grained vocal control. To enhance the quality of generated songs to better align with human preferences, we implement aesthetic alignment through Direct Preference Optimization, which iteratively refines the model using a synthetic dataset, eliminating the need or manual data annotations. Furthermore, we aim to standardize the evaluation of such lyrics-to-song models through our public evaluation dataset JAME. We show that JAM outperforms the existing models in terms of the music-specific attributes.

My adventure in the rain<br>
I can’t find my way, through this concrete mess I made<br>
No one seems to care at all<br>

They look right through you<br>
As if they knew you before<br>
But it don’t matter<br>
You’re not that person No more<br>

And here I go again<br>
Through the darkest place I know<br>
But I’ve seen it all before<br>
<br>
And you know<br>
<br>
I’ve been trying far too long<br>
I know I’ll get there<br>
One more song<br>
And you said I’ll never ever leave you<br>
And you said I’m always gonna need you<br>
And I  said  I’m never ever gonna stay<br>
With the games that you play<br>
<br>
I’m done, I’m done<br>
<br>
Feel the cold again, running around on the road again<br>
My ambition led astray<br>
I won't last another day, in this concrete mess you made<br>
You won’t catch me when I fall<br>
<br>
I’m Done, with the games that you play<br>
They look right through you<br>
As if they knew you before<br>
They look like through you<br>

Same spot<br>
Different places<br>
I can tell that from the look on your face<br>
That we, are way past<br>
Gone are the days<br>
Where we could turn back<br>
And be better off separately<br>
I'm attached<br>
The puppet strings you pull from my back<br>
Moral compass keeps me on track<br>
I get frustrated<br>
No, we won't last<br>
But I don't wanna let you leave<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
I get so defensive<br>
I don't open up<br>
Try to find an exit<br>
From the walls of your love<br>
Why am I pretending?<br>
Like something is wrong<br>
Cause I get lost in my head<br>
When I don't feel good enough<br>
And I RUN!<br>
I RUN!<br>

[Chorus]<br>
I run from myself but I'm stuck in a maze<br>
Scared to get help cause I don't wanna face it<br>
Run out of words, I've got nothing to say<br>
Leaving you hurts<br>
But I don't want you waiting<br>
Run out of breath<br>
Getting stuck in my ways<br>
Need to accept<br>
That I don't want to change<br>
I run out of words<br>
I've got nothing to say<br>
Leaving you hurts<br>
But I'm running away<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Hands on my knees<br>
These roads are too familiar<br>
With the soles of my feet<br>
One minute I'm here with you<br>
Then I up and I leave<br>
No warning just a self-indulgent apology<br>
(I'm sorry)<br>

[Pre-Chorus]<br>
I get so defensive<br>
I don't open up<br>
Try to find an exit<br>
From the walls of your love<br>
Why am I pretending? (-tending)<br>
Like something is wrong (-thing is wrong)<br>
Cause I get lost in my head<br>
When I don't feel good enough<br>
And I RUN!<br>
I RUN!<br>

I run from myself but I'm stuck in a maze<br>
Scared to get help cause I don't wanna face it<br>

Leaving you hurts<br>
But I don't want you waiting<br>
Run out of breath<br>
Getting stuck in my ways (In my way)<br>
Need to accept<br>
That I don't want to change<br>
I run out of words<br>
I've got nothing to say<br>
Leaving you hurts<br>

Went left instead of right, where would my lifestyle steer me? (Where)<br>
If I didn't have fame, would these women still cheerlead? (Would they?)<br>

Got a lighter sentence, went guilty for grub? (Would he?)<br>
Would Jerry be a drunk if he avoided the pub? (Mm)<br>
Would his kids love him more if he weren't beatin' their mum? (Ah)<br>
Would I be doin' time if I took the left and never took the right? (Skrt-skrr)<br>
If I didn't chill in Crane, would weed be my kryptonite? (High)<br>

What if I didn't have your mains in my apartment? (Woo)<br>
What if we linked with **** and still had beef with Brickky? (Nah)<br>
Who am I kiddin'? Any life, man, them **** there ***** (Mm)<br>
Same way if Caresha didn't link up with Diddy<br>
She would still be rappin' 'bout her arse and her titties (Ayy)<br>
If Little Rot 9 didn't fight for our rights<br>
Schools will still be separate, no Blacks and no whites (True)<br>
No Morley's on your left (True), no Shaquels on your right (True)<br>
Sometimes pree life (True) in a whole different light (True, true)<br>
If I had a girl first instead of a son<br>
Would she look like me or would she look like her mum? (Mm)<br>
If music didn't save me, would I still be a bum? (Would I?)<br>
Would I still be slappin' my—?<br>
What if Hollow never made 'Walk in da Park'<br>
I'd say, "Fuck rap, I'm wrappin' up dark"<br>
Made me wanna do music and perfect my craft<br>
Even though we had guns in the car<br>
If PS stayed outta jail, he woulda been top three<br>
And not drill, that's the UK scene<br>
And if we weren't from the 'Narm, we'd still tape off scenes<br>
Blaze machines and still chase that cream<br>

I just feel under the weather, can't afford an umbrella (What a big dent)<br>
What a big dent, water, gas, rent (What a big dent)<br>

Me belt comes heavy like me smoke game<br>
White tee, fresh, so pure like cocaine<br>
Young kid, I'm just left in me own lane<br>
Blow it to the breeze, numb mind so there's no pain<br>
Walking round London, 5 in the morning<br>
I Hopped on a Lime bike, going exploring<br>
Made five tunes while you're tucked up snoring<br>
Don't talk shit, lad, you know you just boring<br>
Need a tour life, Uzi, lad, me life's kinda feeling like a movie<br>
Got the cup and I spilt it on me Ksubis<br>
I'm feeling like Ruby, I'm shooting all the loogies<br>

My Scouse ting's rolling up the jabba<br>
My Yankee one rolling up the grabba<br>
I like my South ting, but she's been a yapper<br>
I fuck 'em all back-to-back, logo of Kappa<br>
I'm a myth, like you lost your friend in Carni<br>
Shell a show in Liverpool, I'm Paul McCartney<br>
I've been stacking bread on top of cheese like a sarni<br>
So she tell me choke her, like The Great Khali<br>

A brand new addiction to not asking why<br>
As hard as it's getting, I'm forgetting to try<br>

Do I have what you don't?<br>
Could you get me alone?<br>
I'm whatever you want and I'm nothing at all<br>
Hoping you'll tell me but scared that you might<br>
Praying you'll take this slowly<br>

Off for a moment back in my stride?<br>
You used to be pretty, I used to be nice<br>
She says I'd look better with her at my side<br>

And she's doing the most, I should give up the ghost<br>
But how can I speak with her hand on my throat<br>
I move my foot back, but she's stepping in time<br>
Can you not make this easy?<br>

He doesn't have anything going for him<br>
But has a little red car, he calls her Carly (Carly)<br>

[Post-Chorus]<br>
Oh-oh, oh (Yeah, yeah)<br>
(Oh, yeah, oh, yeah)<br>
And she says that I can do (Do better, do, do-do-do)<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
On a Tuesday morn' in his bedroom, I lay tangled in his arms<br>
He still lives in his mother's house, but it does add to his charms<br>
I lay my head on his tattooed chest that spells out "Carpe Diem," baby<br>
Then he asked me to be his lady, gotta think 'bout<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Girl, what would your mother say?<br>
She said, "Take your time, baby, you can go both ways"<br>
Girl, what would your daddy say?<br>
Oh, said I could do better, do, do-do-do better<br>
Woo-woo-woo, what would your grandma do?<br>
Oh, what would she do?<br>
She would get on her knees and pray that I don't make this mistake<br>
Grandma calls the boy bad news<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
And she calls the boy<br>
Bad, bad news, baby<br>
Running, running 'round town with her baby<br>
Falling to her knees and she's praying (What would grandma do?)<br>
And now she cussin' me out on the phone<br>
She told me get a car and get my ass back home<br>
Hoping I will come to my senses, oh, oh, oh<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Well, what would your mother say?<br>
She said, "Take your time, baby, you can go both ways"<br>
Girl, what would your daddy say?<br>
He said I could do better, do, do-do-do better<br>
Woo-woo-woo, what would your grandma do?<br>
Oh, what would she do?<br>
She'd get on her knees and pray that I don't make this mistake<br>
Grandma calls the boy bad news<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
And she says that I can do (Do better, do, do-do-do)<br>
And she thinks that I should (Do better, do, do-do-do)<br>
But she thinks that I could (Do better, do, do-do-do)<br>
But who knows if I will or won't or I won't do (Do better, do, do-do-do)<br>

Taking me higher than I've ever been before<br>
I'm holding it back, just wanna shout out, give me more<br>
You're just a hideaway, you're just a feeling<br>
You let my heart escape beyond the meaning<br>
Not even I can find a way to stop the storm<br>
Oh, baby, it's out of my control, what's going on? Mm<br>
You're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming<br>
You're just another day that keeps me breathing<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure<br>
Baby, don't stop me, hideaway with me some more<br>
Ah-ah-ah<br>

[Verse 2]<br>
You're sending me shivers up my spine, might overflow<br>
You're bringing me closer to the edge of letting go, no<br>
You're just a hideaway, you're just a feeling<br>
You let my heart escape beyond no meaning<br>
Pulling my head into the clouds, I'm floating off<br>
When you get me going, I can't find a way to stop, oh-oh<br>
But you're just a chance I take to keep on dreaming<br>
You're just another day that keeps me breathing<br>

Yeah, she cuts like a razor<br>
It's not normal behaviour<br>
Leaves me feeling so blue<br>
And I've forgotten how to feel it<br>
I forgot that I had feelings like you other people do<br>
Till you entered the room<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
Now I'll never ever get another chance<br>
I left you speechless, there's nothing between us<br>
I ignored all the signs<br>
Now I'll never ever get another chance to understand it<br>
I couldn't have planned it<br>
Any worse if I tried<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
'Cause I said me and your sister have the same dealer<br>
I met a few of your friends in Ibiza<br>
They came to a show, so I went out to meet 'em<br>
They say I'm the type of boy that you need and<br>
Every time you post<br>
Oh, it's the most important thing I'll see all day<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
And I'm resisting and reactive<br>
I'm so distant, unattractive<br>
I can't regulate my mood<br>
I talk too much and too loud, it's annoying<br>
But I'm hiding the fact that I'm only avoiding<br>
And dancing 'round the truth<br>
But I won't do that shit to you<br>

"I'm sorry, do I know ya?<br>
Remind me of your name"<br>
I'll say, "I wouldn't say I know ya<br>
But I'd like to get to know you all the same<br>
If that's okay, if that's okay<br>
But I'd like to get to know you all the same<br>
